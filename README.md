## Description

This is a team profile generator built with NodeJS. It uses Inquirer to collect employee info via CLI and generates a sleek HTML output.

## Features

- Quick and easy to use
- Three different employee types: Manager (name, ID, email, office number), Engineer (name, ID, email, GitHub username), and Intern (name, ID, email, school)

## Usage

When you run this app, you will be prompted to input an employee's name, role, ID, email, and then other role-dependent info. You may enter as many employees as you wish.

When you are finished adding employees, a "build" folder with the HTML output will be generated.
